# Data Science Project Folder
- I have created a Data Science folder where I work on data manipulation, machine learning, and predictive modeling. This includes data cleaning, clustering, applying machine learning algorithms, time series forecasting, and data visualization.

## 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- I used Pandas and NumPy for:
    - Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
    - Performing data transformation, feature scaling, and categorical encoding.
    - Executing fast numerical computations with vectorized operations.
## 2. NumPy & Pandas for Data Manipulation
- NumPy:
    - Array operations, mathematical computations, and matrix manipulations.
    - Broadcasting, slicing, indexing, and vectorization for efficiency.
- Pandas:
    - DataFrame and Series operations for structured data handling.
    - Merging, joining, pivoting, and aggregating datasets.
    - Using GroupBy, filtering, and statistical analysis for data summarization.
## 3. Data Visualization
- I used Matplotlib and Seaborn for:
- Bar plots, histograms, pie charts, and scatter plots.
- Customizing plots with labels, legends, gridlines, and colors.
- Subplots and figure adjustments for multiple visualizations.
- Time series visualization to track trends over time.
## 4. Clustering & Unsupervised Learning
- I implemented clustering techniques such as:

- K-Means Clustering â€“ For customer segmentation and pattern recognition.
- Hierarchical Clustering â€“ To analyze relationships in datasets.
- DBSCAN â€“ For density-based clustering and anomaly detection.
## 5. Machine Learning Algorithms
- I applied supervised learning models, including:

- Linear Regression & Multiple Linear Regression â€“ For predictive analysis.
- Logistic Regression (Binary & Multiclass Classification) â€“ For classification tasks.
- Decision Trees & Random Forest â€“ For complex decision-making.
- Support Vector Machines (SVM) â€“ For classification in high-dimensional spaces.
- NaÃ¯ve Bayes â€“ For probabilistic classification.
- K-Means Clustering â€“ For unsupervised learning.
- K-Fold Validation â€“ For model evaluation.
- Cross-validation score â€“ To assess model performance.
- Hyperparameter tuning â€“ For optimizing machine learning models.
- One-hot encoding & dummy variables â€“ For categorical data handling.
## 6. Time Series Analysis & Forecasting
- I worked on time-dependent data using:

- ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) â€“ For trend forecasting.
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks) â€“ For deep learning-based predictions.
- Exponential Smoothing â€“ For seasonal data analysis.
- Applications â€“ Used in stock price prediction, sales forecasting, and demand estimation.
## 7. Additional Work
- Worked on Demographic Data Analysis, Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator, Medical Examination, Page - - View Time Series Visualizer, and Sea Level Predictor.
- Used Excel for data analysis and data science applications.
- Built data pipelines for automating machine learning workflows.
- Implemented feature engineering and dimensionality reduction techniques.

### This Data Science project folder serves as a comprehensive workspace for data preprocessing, NumPy & Pandas operations, machine learning, time series forecasting, and data visualization. ðŸš€
